This project includes both frontend and backend components.

## Running the Backend

Before starting the React app, ensure that your backend server is up and running. Follow the instructions below to start the backend:

1. Navigate to the `src/server` directory.
2. Install the required Python libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install sympy flask flask-cors
    ```

    Ensure that you have Python installed on your system before executing the above command.

3. Run `python app.py` to start the backend server.
4. Your backend server should now be running and accessible.

## Running the Frontend

To run the frontend React app, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Install Plotly.js and React Plotly.js (if not installed already):

    ```bash
    npm install plotly.js-basic-dist
    npm install plotly.js
    npm install react-plotly.js
    ```


4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

The page will reload when you make changes.

The instructions below were automatically generated by react. We left them for extra documentation.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
